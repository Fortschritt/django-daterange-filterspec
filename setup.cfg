# Each of the tools used in the project have their configuration options
# defined here. Usually there is a link to the page that list all of the
# available. Some of the more useful options are listed even when it's
# just the default values that are used. That makes things are easy to
# change if you want.

# Notes:
#
# The order in which the version numbers in docs/conf.py is important.
# If the release number is not processed first (using the default
# regex for parsing) then you will get the following output:
#
#   version = "0.0"
#   release = "version = "0.0""
#
# This has been reported as an issue to bump2version:
# https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version/issues/159
#
# All the various tools have their options synced to the values
# recommended for black since it's the most unforgiving of them all:
# https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/compatible_configs.md
